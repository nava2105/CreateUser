## General Info
This project is a comprehensive **Spring Boot REST API** implementation that uses **Spring Security** with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication and authorization.

- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication via JWT.
  - Role-based access (e.g., `USER` and `ADMIN` roles).
  - REST endpoints for user registration, login, and role assignment.
  - Built-in security configurations, filters, and exception handling for enhanced security.
  - MySQL database integration for persisting users and roles.

Designed for secure APIs involving multiple layers of protection.

---

## Features
The project includes the following capabilities:
- **User Management**:
  - Registration of users with predefined roles.
  - Admin registration and assigning roles dynamically.
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - JWT generation during login to provide a secure communication token.
  - Validation of JWT tokens in subsequent authenticated requests.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - `ADMIN` has extended permissions (e.g., role assignment).
  - `USER` has limited access.
- **Database Initialization**:
  - Pre-populated `USER` and `ADMIN` roles at application startup via initializer.
- **Swagger Integration**:
  - Interactive API documentation available under `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+**: Ensure that Java is installed and configured in your system.
- **MySQL**: Ensure a MySQL database is up and running with credentials that match the application properties.
- **Maven**: Ensure `mvn` is installed.

### Steps to Run the Application:
1. Clone this repository:


2. Configure the database:
- Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the repository with the database credentials:
  ```properties 
  MYSQL_DATABASE=ptrainer_users
  MYSQL_USER=root
  MYSQL_PASSWORD=Mmnsin210606?
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/ptrainer_users?useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root
  SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=Mmnsin210606?
  DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ptrainer_users?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
  DATABASE_USERNAME=root
  DATABASE_PASSWORD=Mmnsin210606?
  ```

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

---

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the API by performing proper requests:

### Register a User:
- Endpoint: `/api/auth/register`
- Payload:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }
  ```

---

## Endpoints
Below is a comprehensive list of the endpoints included in the project:

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)
- **Register User**
  - `POST /api/auth/register`  
    Registers a user with the default `USER` role.
